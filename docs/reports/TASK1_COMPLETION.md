# TASK1 Completion Report

## Completion Metadata

- Completed At: 2026-05-26 09:52:18 KST
- Responsible Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Base Branch: `main`
- Workspace: `/Users/jeonjonghyeok/Documents/Final`

## Summary

Task 1 established the root agent operating rules for this project and added a teammate-facing explanation file.

The work focused on safe project management before implementation: root/folder-level `AGENTS.md` inheritance, workspace boundaries, Spec -> Task -> Subtask planning, review and security check formats, environment variable safety, handover artifacts, and Task startup rules.

## Spec Alignment Checklist

- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` defines top-level principles for all agents.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` limits agent file operations to the current workspace.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` defines four roles: Spec Agent, Task Agent, Implementation Agent, and Review Agent.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` requires Spec -> Task -> Subtask decomposition before implementation.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` requires review after each Task or Subtask.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` includes a detailed security review checklist.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` defines structured review field names and explanatory content standards.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` defines folder-level inheritance and execution path standards.
- [x] Root `AGENTS.md` defines Task completion and handover artifact rules.
- [x] `AGENTS.ko.md` provides teammate-facing context outside the agent-facing `docs/` tree.
- [x] `AGENTS.md` and `AGENTS.ko.md` include a file synchronization rule.

## Changed Files

- `AGENTS.md`
  - Added project-wide agent workflow, security, review, handover, and folder-level instruction rules.
  - Added root/folder-level inheritance rules.
  - Added environment variable and `.env` tracking safety rules.
  - Added Task Completion & Handover Rule and Task Startup Rule.
  - Added a folder-level `AGENTS.md` template.

- `AGENTS.ko.md`
  - Added teammate-facing explanations for the root agent rules.
  - Mirrored the root `AGENTS.md` changes so both files describe the same operating model.

- `docs/reports/TASK1_COMPLETION.md`
  - Created this user-facing Task 1 completion report.

- `docs/specs/TASK2_SUBTASKS.md`
  - Created the next-agent instruction sheet for Task 2.

## Verification Results

- Placeholder scan:
  - Command: `rg -n 'T[O]DO|T[B]D|F[I]XME' AGENTS.md AGENTS.ko.md`
  - Result: No placeholder matches found.

- Markdown code fence scan:
  - Command: `rg -n '```|````' AGENTS.md AGENTS.ko.md`
  - Result: Code fence locations were found and visually checked for matching open/close pairs.

- Section existence scan:
  - Command: `rg -n 'Inheritance Principle|Execution Path Standard|Task Completion & Handover Rule|Task Startup Rule|Environment Variable Safety' AGENTS.md`
  - Result: Required sections and rules are present.

- Lint:
  - Result: Not applicable. This project currently has no configured markdown lint command.

- Unit Test:
  - Result: Not applicable. This project currently has no application code or test runner.

## Security Notes

- No real secrets were added.
- No `.env` or `.env.local` file was read or created.
- Environment variable guidance requires `.env.example` to contain only dummy values.
- Workspace access stayed inside `/Users/jeonjonghyeok/Documents/Final`.

## User Confirmation Needed

- Confirm that Task 1 is accepted as the project agent workflow baseline.
- Confirm whether Task 2 should proceed with repository safety scaffolding first, starting from `.gitignore` and `.env.example`.
- Confirm whether future Task completion reports should use this same report format.
